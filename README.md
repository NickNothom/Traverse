# Traverse

This application aims to create a useful user experience while traveling. It's a small project I looked at, and do not currently work on. But I'll keep it on here for reference. 
I've mainly decided to ignore this because of the recent pushes by major tech companies for the connected car. Also, the Google Android Auto app was released for handsets.
